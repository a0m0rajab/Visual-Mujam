## Visual-Mujam

_Mujam_ is the general name for the books with an index of every word in Quran. Latin name is Concordance.

For instance, the word _Adam_ occurs 25 times in Quran. _Concordantiae_ by G Fl√ºgel shows _Adam_ on [this page](https://archive.org/stream/concordantiaeco00flgoog#page/n28/mode/2up):
![Picture](Adem/Adem%20mucem.jpg)

Then comes computer software. [Here is the list](http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=adm) of all occurrences of the same word with links to follow.

Our aim in this project is to present the word list in a visual context. Here are two samples made manually:
* [Sajdah](https://maeyler.github.io/Visual-Mujam/VM%20sajdah.html)
* [Adam](https://maeyler.github.io/Visual-Mujam/Adem/Adem%20VM.html)

The challenge is to make similar pages automatically for each of the 4700 distinct words in Quran...
