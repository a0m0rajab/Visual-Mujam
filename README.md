## Visual-Mujam

_Mujam_ is the general name for the books with an index of every word in Quran. Latin name is Concordance.

For instance, the word _Adam_ occurs 25 times in Quran. _Concordantiae_ by G Fl√ºgel shows _Adam_ on [this page](https://archive.org/stream/concordantiaeco00flgoog#page/n28/mode/2up):

Then comes software. [Here is the list](http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=adm) of all occurrences of the same word with links to follow.

Our aim in this project is to present the word list in a visual context.
